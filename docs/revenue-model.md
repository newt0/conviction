while ensuring protocol sustainability and long-term economic health.

## 🧱 Three-Layered Revenue Architecture

| Layer         | Content                                      | Purpose                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ① Base Layer  | Fixed fee at NFT mint                        | Initial cash flow / Protocol sustainability  |
| ② Success Fee | Performance-based fee upon 10x return        | Collected only upon success → Fair UX        |
| ③ Activation  | Royalties, bridge fees, fiat integration etc | Diversified revenue via circulation & access |

## ① 💸 Base Revenue: NFT Mint Fee

### ● Overview

- A **fixed fee is added to the NFT price** at the time of minting.
- The majority of the amount is sent to the agent wallet and used as **active capital**.
- The fixed fee becomes ConvictionFi's base income.

#### 📌 Example

- Total payment: \$110

  - \$100 → Sent to smart wallet tied to the NFT (trading capital)
  - \$10 → Protocol revenue

### ● Fee Scheme

| Timing / Plan                   | Fee       | Notes                                              |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎉 Early Campaign / Whitelist   | \$0–\$3   | Boosts UX and engagement; great for viral growth   |
| 💵 Regular Mint                 | \$7       | Simple, psychologically acceptable flat rate       |
| 🧠 High-Value NFTs (e.g. \$500) | \$10–\$15 | Premium tier, higher yield and tailored strategies |

### ● Referral Discount

- Users who mint via **referral links** receive discounted fees (e.g. \$7 → \$3)

### ✔ Dual Benefit (UX + Revenue)

- Minting immediately triggers investment—no extra deposit or approval steps
- Protocol receives instant cash flow at every mint

---

## ② 🏅 Success Fee: Charged at 10x Return

### ● Trigger Condition

- The smart wallet linked to the NFT reaches **10x the original mint amount**
- At that point, a **one-time performance fee (e.g., 7%) is collected from the profit**

### ● Detailed Mechanics

- **One-time collection only** (UX designed like a “graduation ceremony”)
- **Automatically charged at the exit transaction**
- Resold NFTs **reset the base amount** and start a new calculation cycle

### ● SBT Integration: “The 10x Club”

- Users who pay the Success Fee can optionally mint an honorary **SBT**
- Permanently displayed in their wallet
- Will unlock future DAO participation, airdrop benefits, and premium access

## ③ 🔄 Activation Layer: Secondary Revenue Streams

### A. Secondary Royalties

- **5% Creator Fee collected on resale**
- Conviction NFTs include trade history, strategy metadata, and balance
  → Encourages liquidity as tradeable investment instruments

### B. Cross-Chain Bridge Fee (Future Integration)

- For deposits from ETH/USDC → SUI via bridges like Wormhole
  → ConvictionFi may add fees on top of base bridge costs
- Initially **shown only**, to prioritize UX

### C. Fiat Payment Fee (Stripe, etc.)

- When users pay with credit cards via Stripe, an extra \$3–5 fee is added
- May link with premium features like **Instant Mint** or **Priority Access**

## 🧠 Optional Strategies: Voluntary Rewards × Incentives (Future Plans)
