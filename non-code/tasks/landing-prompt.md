Create a complete landing page for a Web3 project called “ConvictionFi”.
The project allows users to mint AI-powered DeFAI NFTs that invest on their behalf.

The page should be modern, minimal, and tailored for a white/light theme.
Use TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui for styling.

Include the following sections, in order:

---

1. Hero Section

- Centered layout
- White background
- Heading: “Mint Your Conviction.”
