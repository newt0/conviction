# 🎙️ ConvictionFi — TTS ナレーション台本（ElevenLabs 対応）

---

**Imagine minting an NFT once —**
and never worrying about crypto trading again.

We present: **ConvictionFi.**
_Mint Your Conviction. Def-Fay-Eye Agent as NFT._

---

Everyone talks about **Def-Fay-Eye** —
Decentralized Finance, powered by AI.
Some even call it “Vibe Trading.”

But in reality?
It’s just a buzzword.
No one knows how to actually use it.

**We don’t just say Def-Fay-Eye or Vibe Trading.**
We deliver it —
through a simple, self-contained interface:

**Def-Fay-Eye Agent as NFT.**
Mint once. Let the agent do the rest.

---

This is Conviction-Driven Automation. On-chain. On NFT.

You don’t manage positions.
You don’t time markets.
You just mint.

Each NFT becomes your autonomous agent.
It holds your funds.
It executes trades.
It reports — transparently, automatically, relentlessly.

All on its own.

---

## Step 1: Choose and Mint Conviction

Choose a thesis.
Like… Sui Maximizer.
Stable Optimizer.
Or… Bitcoin Hodler.

You pick what you believe.
And you mint.
That’s it.

No dashboards.
No approvals.
No complicated setup.

From that moment...
your conviction is on-chain.
And from here —
it acts. Not you.

---

## Step 2: Initialize and Deploy

The NFT creates its own smart wallet.
Your mint price?
It’s transferred into that wallet — and becomes trading capital.

The agent loads its logic and prompt from Walrus.
It deploys via Sui-Agent-Kit.
Now it’s ready to act.

---

## Step 3: Trade and Report

The agent executes trades, staking, or lending.
It reacts to live market data — with no human input.

And it keeps you updated —
**publicly, through Twitter replies.**

Wallet balance.
Trade logs.
Performance since mint.

Your friends can see it.
They can comment.
They can follow along.

Each reply becomes a growth node —
turning belief into visibility.

And if you prefer privacy?
There’s a dashboard for that, too.

**Transparency fuels trust.
Social feedback fuels growth.**

---

## Step 4: Learn and Evolve

Agents aren’t frozen in time.
Their AI logic, strategy modules, and system prompts are stored as part of the NFT’s metadata on Walrus — and they’re upgradable.
This means agents can evolve:
they learn, adapt, and refine themselves as markets shift.

But one thing stays untouched:

The conviction — the belief encoded in the NFT at the moment of mint.
Its theme, its thesis, its soul — that’s written once, and written forever.

Walrus allows us to store both:

Mutable data: AI logic, prompts, and parameters

Immutable data: the core conviction that defines what the NFT stands for

The mind may evolve.
But the soul stays the same.

---

## Step 5: Exit or Transfer

Most agents exit automatically —
when goals are met, or conditions are triggered.

But users still have a choice.
You can transfer your NFT.
Or, if allowed, trigger a refund.

**Exit is guided by belief —
but agency is never taken away.**

---

Most DeFi apps ask you to sign from your main wallet.
That’s not just clunky — it’s dangerous.

Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.

We don’t.

Every ConvictionFi NFT uses an isolated smart wallet.
You never sign again.
And even if the strategy fails —
your personal funds stay safe.

This isn’t just safer infrastructure.
It’s a new UX paradigm:

NFT as Safety Layer —
a firewall between you and protocol-level risk.

NFTs aren’t just assets.
They’re autonomous protectors.

---

**You mint your conviction.
Your agent lives it.
Autonomously. Transparently. On-chain.**

One mint.
One conviction.
One unstoppable agent.

Built for believers — not just traders.
Where AI acts for you — not over you.
Where NFTs become living vaults of conviction.

**ConvictionFi.**
Where belief becomes automation.
Where conviction becomes capital.

Thank you.
