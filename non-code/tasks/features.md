## ConvictionFi — Key Features

- **Mint a DeFAI Agent as an NFT**
  Instantly deploy a self-directed investment agent by minting an NFT that reflects your thesis — from \$SUI staking to \$BTC HODLing.

- **Minting = Capital Deposit**
  The mint price becomes the trading capital. No extra approvals, no complicated setup — mint once and you're done.

- **Fully Autonomous Asset Management**
  Once minted, the agent autonomously executes trades, staking, or lending without user intervention.

- **Dedicated Smart Wallet per NFT**
  Each NFT automatically generates its own smart wallet, isolating funds and strategies for enhanced security and transparency.

- **AI Strategy & Prompt Management via Walrus**
  All logic, prompts, and strategies are stored on Walrus — immutable, transparent, and upgradeable metadata.

- **Decentralized Execution with Sui Agent Kit**
  The agent is instantiated through Sui Agent Kit, enabling native, resilient on-chain execution.

- **Public Reporting via Social Integration**
  Agents post performance updates as replies on X (Twitter): wallet balances, trade logs, and performance snapshots — visible to both the user and their network. User interactions also serve as feedback for adaptive learning.

- **Live Performance Dashboard**
  A dedicated UI allows users to track daily performance, strategy updates, and wallet activity at a glance.

- **NFTs Are Tradable Assets**
  Agents can be sold on the open market. Transfer your strategy — and its performance — to someone else.

- **Withdrawals with Optional Lock Periods**
  Assets can be subject to withdrawal restrictions or made non-withdrawable, turning the NFT itself into a floor-value realization model.

- **Accessible Without Holding \$SUI**
  Minting is available via Wormhole cross-chain bridge or fiat payments, allowing non-crypto users to participate effortlessly.

- **From Conviction to Capital — A UX Evolution**
  ConvictionFi bridges belief and finance. Not just investing, but tokenizing your convictions into autonomous, outcome-driven actions.
