<p>
  <strong>[Project Overview]</strong><br />
  ConvictionFi offers a new paradigm for realizing the vision of DeFi × AI
  (DeFAI). With a single NFT mint, users can delegate conviction-based investing
  to an autonomous AI agent.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Product Type:</strong> DeFAI NFT Protocol</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tagline:</strong>
    <em>“Mint Your Conviction. DeFAI Agent as NFT.”</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Target Audience:</strong> Beginner to intermediate DeFi users,
    ideologically-driven investors, Web3 natives
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>[PROBLEM: DeFAI Is Just a Buzzword]</strong><br />
  Terms like “DeFAI” and “Vibe Trading” are everywhere—but they lack
  substance.<br />
  Most so-called DeFAI products suffer from vague use cases, fragmented user
  experiences, and an overall lack of clarity about what it actually means to
  "use DeFAI."
</p>

<p>
  <strong>[SOLUTION: DeFAI Agent as NFT]</strong><br />
  We built a complete, intuitive experience: the DeFAI Agent as an NFT.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users simply mint an NFT</li>
  <li>That NFT becomes a standalone AI agent managing the user’s capital</li>
  <li>No dashboards. No approvals. No ongoing management</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>[USER FLOW: Just Mint NFT]</strong><br />
  ConvictionFi follows a 5-step lifecycle.<br />
  Only Step 1 requires your input — from Step 2 onward, your agent takes over.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Mint Your Conviction</strong><br />Choose a belief. Mint the NFT.
    That’s it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>NFT = AI Agent</strong><br />The NFT becomes an autonomous, on-chain
    trader.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Autonomous Execution</strong><br />The agent trades, stakes, or
    lends — no input needed. All activity is publicly reported.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Learn & Evolve</strong><br />The agent adapts based on market
    signals or strategy upgrades.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Exit or Transfer</strong><br />Withdraw via protocol rules — or sell
    the NFT on secondary markets.
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>[Sample Strategy]</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>SUI_MAXIMIZER</strong><br />
    - Aggressive accumulation of SUI and ecosystem tokens during market dips<br />
    - <em>Ideological Thesis:</em> "Sui represents the future of blockchain
    scalability. Every dip is an opportunity to accumulate before mass
    adoption."
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>BTC_HODLER</strong><br />
    - Long-term Bitcoin accumulation with DCA and volatility exploitation<br />
    - <em>Ideological Thesis:</em> "Bitcoin is digital gold and the ultimate
    store of value. Time in market beats timing the market."
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>STABLE_OPTIMIZER</strong><br />
    - Conservative yield optimization across stable pools and lending
    protocols<br />
    -
    <em
      >"Consistent yield generation with capital preservation. Compound interest
      is the eighth wonder of the world."</em
    >
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  <strong>[SECURITY MODEL: NFT as Safety Layer]</strong><br />
  Most DeFi apps require direct wallet transactions, creating unnecessary risk
  and inconvenience.<br />
  ConvictionFi uses a different approach: your minted NFT becomes both entry
  point and autonomous firewall.<br />
  The minting price becomes your trading budget — no additional deposits or
  approvals needed.<br />
  Each NFT generates its own isolated smart wallet, completely separate from
  your personal funds.<br />
  Only the NFT agent signs transactions and takes action.<br />
  Your risk is compartmentalized, your conviction tokenized, and your NFT thinks
  and acts independently — keeping your wallet safe.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>[TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE: Walrus x NFT x AI]</strong><br />
  ConvictionFi leverages Walrus decentralized storage to ensure immutable and
  transparent NFT metadata for conviction-based trading agents.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strategy parameters and logic</li>
  <li>Conviction statements and reasoning</li>
  <li>Risk limits and execution policies</li>
  <li>Agent version history and mint timestamps</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The system utilizes Walrus's key features: content-addressed storage with
  verifiable CIDs for data integrity, permanent append-only architecture
  preventing deletions or secret alterations, and full transparency allowing
  anyone to inspect metadata via URI.<br />
  This approach ensures complete audit trails as trading agents evolve through
  versioned updates.<br />
  Each NFT contains a Walrus metadata URI that points to the latest version
  while preserving access to historical versions for verification.<br />
  The JSON-formatted data includes strategy details, risk profiles, whitelisted
  contracts, and execution policies.<br />
  Since Walrus is append-only, strategy upgrades create new versions rather than
  overwriting existing data, ensuring full traceability of agent evolution over
  time.
</p>

<p>
  This storage solution guarantees transparency, auditability, and
  future-proofing without requiring large metadata storage directly on-chain,
  while ensuring all strategy changes remain traceable and potentially subject
  to governance approval.
