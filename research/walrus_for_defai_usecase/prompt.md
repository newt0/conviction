Please perform a comprehensive DeepResearch investigation on how **Walrus can be leveraged within the Sui ecosystem** to support the ConvictionFi/DeFAI use case. Focus specifically on integrating AI agents, NFT-based DeFi strategies, and trigger-driven execution. Organize your findings in Markdown format, suitable for technical documentation.

## üîç Topics to Cover:

### 1. Technical Role of Walrus on Sui

- Implementation architecture on Sui
- Comparison with Arweave, Lit Protocol
- Read/write structure and cost implications

### 2. Integration with AI Agents

- How agents can read from Walrus-stored prompts and observation targets
- Persistent vs ephemeral memory patterns
- Compatibility with Sui Agent Kit and other execution tools

### 3. Metadata-Driven DeFi Strategy

- Feasibility of storing the following inside NFT metadata:
  - Investment theme (e.g., $TRUMP, AI stocks)
  - System prompt
  - Watch targets (e.g., social accounts, APIs)
  - Execution triggers (price changes, keyword detection, etc.)
- Agent behavior when referencing this metadata

### 4. ConvictionFi Workflow Architecture

- Full pipeline: Mint NFT ‚Üí Write strategy to Walrus ‚Üí Agent monitors and triggers on-chain execution
- Pros/cons and potential bottlenecks

### 5. Real-World Adoption and Development Activity

- Projects using Walrus on Sui
- Hackathon submissions and support from Sui Foundation

Make sure to emphasize technical feasibility, especially in the context of on-chain automation driven by off-chain metadata and agent logic.
