# âœ… **100/100 DeepResearch Prompt**

---

**ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:**
Please conduct a **deep technical and strategic research analysis** of **Walrus**, the decentralized storage protocol developed by **Mysten Labs**, in order to support decision-making for **Web3 product managers considering its integration** in their dApps or ecosystem infrastructure.

---

**ðŸ“„ Output Format:**
Produce a structured **Markdown-based research report**, using clear section headings, bullet points, and tables where appropriate. Focus on clarity and practical insights.

---

**ðŸ“š Topics to Cover:**

### 1. **Technical Architecture and Sui Integration**

- What is **Red Stuff encoding** and how does it enhance data resilience?
- How does Walrus **interact with the Sui blockchain** (e.g. Move modules, verification, etc.)?
- How does Walrus handle **data availability**, **reconstruction**, and **latency trade-offs**?

### 2. **Tokenomics and Incentive Mechanisms**

- What is the role of the **\$WAL token** in storage, validation, and incentives?
- How does the **reward and slashing mechanism** for node participants work?
- What is the **token supply model** and distribution structure?

### 3. **Use Cases and Implementation Examples**

- How can Walrus be used in real-world dApps (e.g. NFTs, on-chain AI models, SBTs)?
- Are there any **live integrations or PoCs** already running on Sui that utilize Walrus?

### 4. **Comparative Analysis with Arweave, Celestia, and Avail**

- Provide a **comparison table** covering performance, cost, immutability, data persistence, and L1/L2 composability.
- Highlight **differentiators** that justify choosing Walrus over other DA/storage solutions.

### 5. **Roadmap and Strategic Positioning**

- What is the current status of the **mainnet** or testnet launch?
- What is the plan for **multi-chain support**, if any?
- How does Walrus align with Mysten Labsâ€™ broader **ecosystem strategy** (including the Sui Foundationâ€™s roadmap)?

---

**ðŸ”Ž Required Source Materials:**
Please incorporate and cite relevant information from:

- **The official Walrus whitepaper**
- **Mysten Labs blog posts**
- **GitHub repositories**
- **@Mysten_Labs on X (formerly Twitter)**
- Reputable media coverage (e.g. Decrypt, Blockworks, The Block, CoinPost)

---

**ðŸ—“ Research Scope / Timeframe:**
Focus on information from **December 2024 to May 2025** to ensure all findings are up-to-date.

---

**ðŸ§  Perspective / Analysis Style:**
Frame insights from the perspective of a:

- **Product Manager** evaluating technical feasibility,
- **VC/Investor** assessing protocol potential, or
- **dApp Developer** exploring integration strategy.

Please clarify the lens used in your analysis.

---

**âœ… Expected Output Use Cases:**

- Architecture validation for dApps using Walrus
- Storage layer selection matrix for Sui-native applications
- Strategic pitch for hybrid DA/storage models using Walrus + Celestia
