# 🧠 ConvictionFi

_Mint Your Conviction. DeFAI Agent as NFT._

ConvictionFi is a belief-driven automation protocol that turns your personal investment thesis into an autonomous NFT agent. Once minted, your NFT manages your capital on-chain — fully automated, fully transparent, and free from manual ops.

## 🚀 What is ConvictionFi?

ConvictionFi bridges **Decentralized Finance** and **AI agents** through a simple UX layer:  
**One NFT = One Autonomous DeFAI Agent.**

- No dashboards
- No approvals
- No custody risk
- Just **pure conviction**, encoded on-chain

> Built for believers — not just traders.

---

## 🧩 Why Now?

Everyone talks about “DeFAI” and “Vibe Trading,” but...

- Use cases are unclear
- Interfaces are broken
- There’s no real “product experience” — only hype

**ConvictionFi** delivers the first true DeFAI experience through self-governing NFT agents.

## 🛠️ How It Works

ConvictionFi follows a 5-step lifecycle.  
**Only Step 1 requires your input.** The rest is autonomous.

### 1. Choose & Mint Conviction

- Pick a thesis (e.g. \$SUI staking, \$BTC HODLing)
- Mint your NFT agent (mint price = trading capital)
- That’s it — you're done.

### 2. Initialize & Deploy

- NFT creates its **own smart wallet**
- Capital is transferred into the wallet
- Agent strategy is loaded from **Walrus**
- Agent is instantiated using **Sui Agent Kit**

### 3. Trade & Report

- Agent executes trades, staking, or lending
- Real-time updates are posted **via Twitter replies**
- Private dashboard also available

### 4. Learn & Evolve

- Strategy is versioned via **Walrus metadata**
- Agent evolves, but **conviction remains immutable**

### 5. Exit or Transfer

- Automatic exit via thresholds / lockup expiry
- User may resell NFT or claim refunds (if enabled)

## 🛡️ Security Model

> _“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.”_

Unlike traditional DeFi:

- Each NFT uses an **isolated smart wallet**
- **No post-mint approvals**
- Even if the strategy fails, **your main wallet is never touched**

NFT = **autonomous firewall**, not a collectible.

## ✨ Philosophy

ConvictionFi is not just about automation. It's about **aligning belief and capital**.

> Where belief becomes automation.  
> Where conviction becomes capital.
