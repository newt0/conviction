## [PROBLEM] DeFAI Is Just a Buzzword

In 2025, DeFAI (DeFi √ó AI) is one of crypto‚Äôs hottest trends ‚Äî but most products lack depth.
Use cases remain vague, UX is fragmented, and the core value of ‚Äúusing DeFAI‚Äù is unclear.

## [SOLUTION] Vibe Trading on Conviction. DeFAI Agent as NFT

ConvictionFi introduces two key concepts to deliver a real DeFAI experience:

- **Vibe Trading on Conviction**
- **DeFAI Agent as NFT**

Users mint an NFT tied to their conviction ‚Äî e.g., `$SUI_MAXI`, `$BTC_HODLER`, or `$TRUMP_SUPPORTER`.
Each NFT becomes an AI agent with its own smart contract wallet and trading strategy.
Mint it, and let the agent handle the rest.

## [USER-FLOW] Just Mint NFT

ConvictionFi follows a five-step flow, but users make only one decision: minting.

1. **Mint** ‚Äî Pick and mint your NFT.
2. **NFT = AI Agent** ‚Äî It gets its own wallet and trades using the mint amount.
3. **Trade & Report** ‚Äî Autonomous activity is posted via Twitter replies, making each NFT a self-marketing engine.
4. **Evolve** ‚Äî Strategies learn and improve over time.
5. **Exit** ‚Äî AI auto-exits via time or profit triggers. Or, sell the NFT on a marketplace.

## [FEATURES]

### üõ°Ô∏è New Security Model: Safety Layer as NFT

DeFi traditionally requires users to interact directly with contracts ‚Äî exposing them to unnecessary risk.
ConvictionFi offers a better model:

- No separate deposits or approvals. Minting = Funding
- Minting Price = Trading Budget
- Each NFT creates a fully isolated smart contract wallet
- Only the agent signs transactions
- Your main wallet stays untouched

Your conviction is tokenized, your risk is compartmentalized, and your NFT acts autonomously.

### üß† Walrus Integration: AI Works on Walrus

All ConvictionNFTs store AI prompts, trading logic, and agent history as verifiable metadata on Walrus, a decentralized append-only storage system.

Stored data includes:

- Strategy parameters and reasoning
- Risk thresholds and execution policies
- Version history with immutable timestamps
- JSON-formatted metadata accessible via CID/URI

This ensures full auditability, upgrade traceability, and governance potential ‚Äî without storing bloated data directly on-chain.

## [REVENUE] Sustainable Revenue, Seamless UX

ConvictionFi aligns sustainable monetization with a seamless UX:

- Mint Fee: $5‚Äì7 flat ‚Äî incentivizes larger commitments.
- Royalty: 5% on secondary trades ‚Äî drives exit-based liquidity.
- Success Fee: 7% one-time only when wallet hits 10√ó mint value ‚Äî earns access to The 10x Club SBT, linked to $CONVICTION airdrops.

No hidden fees. Fiat and cross-chain minting supported with minimal friction.
We optimize for TVL and user growth ‚Äî not extractive monetization.

## Sample Strategy

1. **SUI_MAXIMIZER**
   Aggressively accumulates $SUI and ecosystem tokens during dips.
   Thesis: ‚ÄúSui represents the future of scalable blockchains. Buy every dip.‚Äù

2. **BTC_HODLER**
   DCA strategy with volatility filters.
   Thesis: ‚ÄúBitcoin is digital gold. Time in market > timing the market.‚Äù
3. **STABLE_OPTIMIZER**
   Conservative yield farming with capital preservation.
   Thesis: ‚ÄúCompound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.‚Äù
