## 🚨[PROBLEM] State of DeFAI

In 2025, DeFAI (DeFi + AI) is one of crypto’s hottest trends.
But in reality, **“DeFAI” and “Vibe Trading” are just buzzwords** — no product has nailed the UX or achieved PMF.

## 💡[SOLUTION] DeFAI Agent as NFT

As concrete UX, ConvictionFi introduces two core ideas:

- **Vibe Trading on Conviction**
- **DeFAI Agent as NFT**

Users mint an NFT that matches their conviction — like `SUI_MAXI`, `BTC_HODLER`, or `TRUMP_SUPPORTER`.
Each NFT becomes an autonomous AI agent with its own wallet and strategy.
**Mint it, and let AI take over.**

## [USERFLOW] Just Mint NFT

1. **Mint**: Users pick an NFT and mint it. That's all the decision-making users need to do. Everything else happens automatically
2. **NFT becomes AI Agent**: Each minted NFT runs its own wallet and trades autonomously, using the mint price as its budget. Strategy logic and AI prompts are stored as NFT metadata on Walrus.
3. **Trade & Report**: The agent trades, stakes, or lends — no input needed. Every trade is reported via Twitter replies — where crypto users already live. So each NFT becomes its own viral marketing engine.
4. **Evolve**: Investment strategy logic is updatable. Based on trading performance evaluations and user feedback, strategies continuously learn, improve, and evolve into more sophisticated forms.
5. **Exit**: The hardest part of investing is knowing when to exit.ConvictionFi handles it for you — auto-selling based on time or profit triggers, and sending real profits to your wallet.
