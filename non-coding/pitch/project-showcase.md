# 🧠 ConvictionFi — DeFAI Agent as NFT

Hi all, I'm Kyohei, founder of **ConvictionFi**, joining from Japan 🇯🇵.

Just choose your conviction — and AI does the investing for you.
**The UX? Simply mint an NFT.**

## 🚨 [PROBLEM] The State of DeFAI

In 2025, DeFAI (DeFi + AI) is one of the hottest trends in crypto.
But in reality, **“DeFAI” and “Vibe Trading” are just buzzwords** — no project has nailed the UX or achieved PMF.

## 💡 [SOLUTION] DeFAI Agent as NFT

ConvictionFi introduces two core concepts that define its ideal UX:

- **Vibe Trading on Conviction**
- **DeFAI Agent as NFT**

Users mint an NFT that reflects their conviction — like `SUI_MAXI`, `BTC_HODLER`, or `TRUMP_SUPPORTER`.
Each NFT becomes an autonomous AI agent with its own wallet and trading logic.
**Mint it, and let the AI take over.**

## 🧭 [USER FLOW] One Decision: Mint

ConvictionFi has five steps, but users only make one decision: minting.

1. **Mint** — Pick your NFT and mint it. That’s the only decision you make.
2. **NFT = AI Agent** — Each NFT runs its own wallet and trades autonomously, using the mint price as its budget. Logic and AI prompts are stored as NFT metadata on Walrus.
3. **Trade & Report** — The agent trades, stakes, and lends. All activity is transparently posted via Twitter replies, turning each NFT into a viral marketing engine.
4. **Evolve** — Each strategy evolves — driven by data and feedback.
5. **Exit** — Exiting is the hardest part of investing. ConvictionFi auto-exits based on time or profit triggers and sends profits to your wallet—no “cash out anytime” button, no decision fatigue. Alternatively, just sell your NFT.
