## :brain: ConvictionFi — DeFAI Agent as NFT

Hi all, I'm Kyohei, the creator of **ConvictionFi**.

Just choose your conviction — and AI does the investing for you.
**The UX? Simply mint an NFT.**

### :rotating_light: The Problem: State of DeFAI

In 2025, DeFAI (DeFi + AI) is one of crypto’s hottest trends.
But in reality, **“DeFAI” and “Vibe Trading” are just buzzwords** — no product has nailed the UX or achieved PMF.

### :bulb: The Solution: DeFAI Agent as NFT

ConvictionFi introduces two core ideas:

- **Vibe Trading on Conviction**
- **DeFAI Agent as NFT**

Users mint an NFT that matches their conviction — like `SUI_MAXI`, `BTC_HODLER`, or `TRUMP_SUPPORTER`.
Each NFT becomes an autonomous AI agent with its own wallet and strategy.
**Mint it, and let AI take over.**

### :compass: User Flow (just 1 step for users)

1. Mint an NFT. Done.
2. NFT gets its own wallet and trades autonomously.
3. All trades are reported via Twitter/X replies.
4. Strategy evolves with data & feedback.
5. Exit via AI trigger or NFT resale.

### :shield: NFT as Safety Layer

Each NFT has an isolated smart contract wallet, acting as a proxy.
Even if something goes wrong, your main assets stay safe.

---

ConvictionFi automates investment based on conviction.
It’s the simplest DeFAI UX yet.
