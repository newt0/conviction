# ✅ ConvictionFi Pitch Script (v7)

## [OPENING]

**Choose conviction. AI executes the optimal investment strategy.**
**The UX? Simply mint an NFT.**

**That's ConvictionFi.**

## [PROBLEM] The Current State of DeFAI

In 2025, the hottest trend in crypto is DeFAI - the fusion of DeFi and AI.
DeFi's complexity has already surpassed human cognitive capacity, making AI integration inevitable
However, "DeFAI" and "Vibe Trading" remain largely marketing buzzwords.
No project has yet defined concrete UX or achieved product-market fit.

## [SOLUTION] DeFAI Agent as NFT

We propose two core concepts:
**"Vibe Trading on Conviction"** and **"DeFAI Agent as NFT"**.

Each NFT works as an AI agent with its own wallet, automatically managing investments based on specific strategies.
Each NFT's investment strategy abstracts users' beliefs and convictions.

For example, SUI_MAXI bets on Sui's future potential, BTC_HODLER believes in the Bitcoin narrative, or TRUMP_SUPPORTER—diverse strategies tailored to different ideologies and positions.

Users simply select and mint an NFT that aligns with their ideology.
From there, AI handles everything.

## [USERFLOW]

ConvictionFi consists of a 5-step lifecycle, but **users only need to make decisions in the first step**.

### Step 1: Mint

Users select and mint an NFT.

That's all the decision-making users need to do.
Everything else happens automatically

### Step 2: NFT becomes AI Agent

The minted NFT autonomously executes trades.

Each minted NFT operates with its own smart contract wallet, using the mint amount as its trading budget.
Investment strategies abstracting ideologies and AI system prompts are hosted on Walrus as NFT metadata.

### Step 3: Trade & Report

Trading activities are reported to users through Twitter replies.
Since Twitter is where crypto users spend most of their time, this also serves as our organic growth strategy.
Every time a DeFAI NFT mints and starts trading, it naturally creates viral marketing.

### Step 4: Learn & Evolve

Investment strategy logic is updatable.
Based on trading performance evaluations and user feedback, strategies continuously learn, improve, and evolve into more sophisticated forms.

### Step 5: Exit

The hardest part of investing? Knowing when to exit.
Unrealized gains are just numbers on a screen—they're not real money until you sell.
This is exactly where AI should step in.
ConvictionFi automatically exits positions based on preset triggers like time limits or profit targets, then sends the actual profits to your wallet.

We intentionally don't include a "cash out anytime" button because that would just stress users out with constant decision-making.
Instead, users can actively exit by selling their NFT on the secondary market.
Unlike traditional NFTs that are basically digital art, ConvictionFi NFTs actually hold real assets—giving them concrete value.

## [FEATURES]

### Safety Layer as NFT

Current DeFi exposes user wallets directly to smart contracts, creating structural risk.
Even skilled traders and engineers have lost money to exploits.
I haven't been targeted yet, but it's statistical probability, not personal precaution.

To solve this, we introduce the "Safety Layer as NFT":
Each NFT acts as a transaction proxy with its own wallet, fully isolated from the user’s.
No matter what happens during trading, your main assets remain untouched.

## [REVENUE]

ConvictionFi balances stress-free UX with sustainable profitability.
Our revenue model has three main cash points: minting fees, trading royalties, and success bonuses.

First, fixed fees at mint ($5-7).
Since this isn't percentage-based, users are incentivized to mint larger amounts at once.

Second, royalties from NFT secondary trading (5%).
Since ConvictionFi encourages secondary trading as an exit method, NFT liquidity becomes active.
This leverages NFT characteristics for revenue generation.

Finally, performance-based success fees.
However, these only activate for exceptional returns.
When an NFT wallet balance reaches 10x the mint amount, we collect 7% of profits as a one-time success fee.

Achievers receive the prestigious **"The 10x Club" SBT, directly connecting to future $CONVICTION token allocation**.

For fiat and cross-chain mints, we charge only minimal fees to avoid disadvantaging non-crypto users.
Rather than "hidden charges," we pursue mint volume and total assets under management as KPIs.

## [ENDING]

Vibe Trading on Conviction.
DeFAI Agent as NFT.
Thank you.
