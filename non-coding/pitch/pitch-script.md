# ✅ ConvictionFi Pitch Script (v7)

## [OPENING]

Choose conviction. AI invests for you.
**The UX? Simply mint an NFT.**

**That's ConvictionFi.**

## [PROBLEM] The Current State of DeFAI

In 2025, DeFAI — where DeFi meets AI — is the hottest trend in crypto.
DeFi has grown too complex for humans alone, so AI is no longer optional.

But right now, “DeFAI” and “Vibe Trading” are just buzzwords.
No project has nailed the UX or hit PMF.

## [SOLUTION] DeFAI Agent as NFT

We propose two core concepts:
**"Vibe Trading on Conviction"** and **"DeFAI Agent as NFT"**.

Each NFT is an AI agent with its own wallet, managing trades based on predefined strategies.

Each strategy abstracts a core conviction, turning belief into behavior — SUI_MAXI, BTC_HODLER, TRUMP_SUPPORTER.
All users do is mint an NFT that matches their view.
From there, AI takes over.

## [USERFLOW]

ConvictionFi has five steps, but users only make one decision: minting.

### Step 1: Mint

Users pick an NFT and mint it.

That's all the decision-making users need to do.
Everything else happens automatically

### Step 2: NFT becomes AI Agent

Each minted NFT runs its own wallet and trades autonomously, using the mint amount as its budget.
Strategy logic and AI prompts are stored as metadata on Walrus.

### Step 3: Trade & Report

Every trade is reported via Twitter replies—where crypto users already live.
So each NFT becomes its own viral marketing engine.

### Step 4: Learn & Evolve

Each strategy evolves—driven by data and feedback.

### Step 5: Exit

The hardest part of investing? Knowing when to exit.
Unrealized gains are just numbers—they’re not real until you sell.
This is exactly where AI should step in.

ConvictionFi exits based on triggers like time or profit targets, and sends the profits to your wallet.

We don’t offer a “cash out anytime” button—because it would force users to carry the burden of constant decision-making.

Instead, you can exit by selling your NFT on the secondary market.
And unlike most NFTs, ConvictionFi NFTs hold real assets, giving them actual value.

## [FEATURES]

### Safety Layer as NFT

In DeFi, wallets interact directly with smart contracts — opening users to risk.
Even top traders have lost funds to exploits.
I haven’t — but that’s statistical probability, not personal precaution.

To solve this, we introduce the “Safety Layer as NFT.”
Each NFT has its own wallet and acts as a proxy, fully isolated from yours.
So even if something goes wrong, your main assets stay safe.

## [REVENUE]

ConvictionFi offers both the best UX and a sustainable revenue model.

We monetize through three streams: mint fees, trading royalties, and success bonuses.

First, a fixed mint fee of $5–7.
Because it’s not percentage-based, users are incentivized to mint larger amounts at once.

Second, a 5% royalty on secondary trades.
Since we encourage resale as an exit method, this creates healthy NFT liquidity.

Finally, a one-time 7% success fee—only when an NFT wallet hits 10x its mint amount.
Those who achieve this milestone earn the "10x Club" SBT, tied to future $CONVICTION allocation.

We keep fiat and cross-chain mint fees minimal to ensure fair access.
No hidden charges — our KPIs are mint volume and total assets under management.

## [ENDING]
