[Project Overview]
ConvictionFi offers a new paradigm for realizing the vision of DeFi × AI (DeFAI). With a single NFT mint, users can delegate conviction-based investing to an autonomous AI agent.
- Product Type: DeFAI NFT Protocol
- Tagline: _“Mint Your Conviction. DeFAI Agent as NFT.”_
- Target Audience: Beginner to intermediate DeFi users, ideologically-driven investors, Web3 natives

[PROBLEM: DeFAI Is Just a Buzzword]
Terms like “DeFAI” and “Vibe Trading” are everywhere—but they lack substance.
Most so-called DeFAI products suffer from vague use cases, fragmented user experiences, and an overall lack of clarity about what it actually means to "use DeFAI."

[SOLUTION: DeFAI Agent as NFT]
We built a complete, intuitive experience: the DeFAI Agent as an NFT.
- Users simply mint an NFT
- That NFT becomes a standalone AI agent managing the user’s capital
- No dashboards. No approvals. No ongoing management

[USER FLOW: Just Mint NFT]
ConvictionFi follows a 5-step lifecycle. 
Only Step 1 requires your input — from Step 2 onward, your agent takes over.

1. Mint Your Conviction
   Choose a belief. Mint the NFT. That’s it.
2. NFT = AI Agent
  The NFT becomes an autonomous, on-chain trader.
3. Autonomous Execution
  The agent trades, stakes, or lends — no input needed.
  All activity is publicly reported.
4. Learn & Evolve
  The agent adapts based on market signals or strategy upgrades.
5. Exit or Transfer
  Withdraw via protocol rules — or sell the NFT on secondary markets.


[Sample Strategy]
1. SUI_MAXIMIZER
- Aggressive accumulation of SUI and ecosystem tokens during market dips
- Ideological Thesis: "Sui represents the future of blockchain scalability. Every dip is an opportunity to accumulate before mass adoption."

2. BTC_HODLER
- Long-term Bitcoin accumulation with DCA and volatility exploitation
-  Ideological Thesis: "Bitcoin is digital gold and the ultimate store of value. Time in market beats timing the market."

3. STABLE_OPTIMIZER
- Conservative yield optimization across stable pools and lending protocols
- "Consistent yield generation with capital preservation. Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world."

[SECURUTY MODEL: NFT as Safety Layer]

Most DeFi apps require direct wallet transactions, creating unnecessary risk and inconvenience. 
ConvictionFi uses a different approach: your minted NFT becomes both entry point and autonomous firewall.
The minting price becomes your trading budget — no additional deposits or approvals needed. 
Each NFT generates its own isolated smart wallet, completely separate from your personal funds. 
Only the NFT agent signs transactions and takes action.
Your risk is compartmentalized, your conviction tokenized, and your NFT thinks and acts independently—keeping your wallet safe.

[TECHINICAL ARCHITECTURE: Walrus x NFT x AI]
ConvictionFi leverages Walrus decentralized storage to ensure immutable and transparent NFT metadata for conviction-based trading agents. 
Each Conviction NFT stores comprehensive data on Walrus including:
- Strategy parameters and logic
- Conviction statements and reasoning
- Risk limits and execution policies
- Agent version history and mint timestamps
The system utilizes Walrus's key features: content-addressed storage with verifiable CIDs for data integrity, permanent append-only architecture preventing deletions or secret alterations, and full transparency allowing anyone to inspect metadata via URI. 
This approach ensures complete audit trails as trading agents evolve through versioned updates.
Each NFT contains a Walrus metadata URI that points to the latest version while preserving access to historical versions for verification. 
The JSON-formatted data includes strategy details, risk profiles, whitelisted contracts, and execution policies. 
Since Walrus is append-only, strategy upgrades create new versions rather than overwriting existing data, ensuring full traceability of agent evolution over time.

This storage solution guarantees transparency, auditability, and future-proofing without requiring large metadata storage directly on-chain, while ensuring all strategy changes remain traceable and potentially subject to governance approval.
