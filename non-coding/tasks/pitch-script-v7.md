**Choose an ideology or belief, and AI executes the optimal investment strategy.**
**The UX? Simply mint an NFT.**

**That's ConvictionFi.**

## [PROBLEM] The Current State of DeFAI

In 2025, the most anticipated development in the crypto industry is DeFAI—the convergence of DeFi and AI.
The complexity of DeFi has already exceeded human cognitive limits, making AI integration an inevitable outcome.
However, "DeFAI" and "Vibe Trading" remain largely marketing buzzwords.
No project has yet defined concrete UX or achieved product-market fit.

## [SOLUTION] DeFAI Agent as NFT

We propose two core concepts:
**"Vibe Trading on Conviction"** and **"DeFAI Agent as NFT"**.

NFTs function as AI agents with their own wallets and signing authority, executing autonomous asset management on behalf of users according to predetermined strategies.

Each NFT's investment strategy abstracts users' beliefs and convictions.
For example, SUI_MAXI bets on Sui's future potential, BTC_HODLER believes in the Bitcoin narrative, or TRUMP_SUPPORTER—diverse strategies tailored to different ideologies and positions.

Users simply select and mint an NFT that aligns with their ideology.
From there, AI handles everything.

## [USERFLOW]

ConvictionFi consists of a 5-step lifecycle, but **users only need to make decisions in the first step**.

### Step 1: Mint

Users select and mint an NFT.

User decision-making ends here. All subsequent steps are passive.

### Step 2: NFT becomes AI Agent

The minted NFT autonomously executes trades.

Each minted NFT has an independent smart contract wallet, with the mint amount serving as its budget.

Investment strategies abstracting ideologies and AI system prompts are hosted on Walrus as NFT metadata.

### Step 3: Trade & Report

Trading activities are reported to users in Twitter reply format.
Twitter is the interface crypto users engage with most frequently, while simultaneously serving as our product's growth hack mechanism.

Essentially, the very act of minting and operating DeFAI NFTs becomes inherent viral marketing.

### Step 4: Learn & Evolve

Investment strategy logic is updatable.
Based on trading performance evaluations and user feedback, strategies continuously learn, improve, and evolve into more sophisticated forms.

### Step 5: Exit

The most challenging aspect of investing is the "Exit."
Unrealized gains are merely illusions that deceive people—they're not reality.
Exit is precisely the domain AI should handle.

ConvictionFi automatically executes exits based on triggers like time periods or target amounts, with profits sent to users' wallets.

We deliberately exclude "manual refund functionality" because it would burden users with "decision responsibility" and "anxiety."

Instead, we provide NFT secondary trading as an active exit option.

While traditional NFTs lack substantial asset backing, ConvictionFi NFTs hold assets themselves, providing price justification.

## [FEATURES]

### Safety Layer as NFT

Current DeFi directly exposes user wallets to smart contracts, which is structurally risky.

Many excellent traders and engineers have fallen victim to exploits.
I haven't been affected yet, but that's merely probability.

To address this structural challenge, we propose the **"Safety Layer as NFT"** paradigm.

In this model, NFTs stand between users and DeFi protocols, acting as transaction proxies.
NFTs have independent wallets, completely separated from users' personal wallets.
Therefore, regardless of what happens during trading, users' main assets are never at risk.

## [REVENUE]

ConvictionFi balances stress-free UX with sustainable profitability.
Our revenue model has three main cash points: Mint, secondary trading, and performance.

First, fixed fees at mint ($5-7).
Since this isn't percentage-based, users are incentivized to mint larger amounts at once.

Second, royalties from NFT secondary trading (5%).
Since ConvictionFi encourages secondary trading as an exit method, NFT liquidity becomes active.
This leverages NFT characteristics for revenue generation.

Finally, performance-based success fees.
However, these only activate for exceptional returns.
When an NFT wallet balance reaches 10x the mint amount, we collect 7% of profits as a one-time success fee.

Achievers receive the prestigious **"The 10x Club" SBT, directly connecting to future $CONVICTION token allocation**.

For fiat and cross-chain mints, we charge only minimal fees to avoid disadvantaging non-crypto users.
Rather than "hidden charges," we pursue mint volume and total assets under management as KPIs.

## [TEAM] Founder Introduction

I'm among the most accomplished individuals in Japan's NFT space.
I've successfully executed multiple NFT sales exceeding $500K and achieved results with NFT-powered B2B SaaS products.
I've confronted both expectations and disappointments surrounding NFTs on the front lines.
This experience led me to conceive "DeFAI Agent as NFT" as NFT's most practical use case.

I deliberately tackled this hackathon solo.
In the post-AI era of product development, completing everything from idea conception and validation to MVP construction alone is the fastest and most rational approach.
