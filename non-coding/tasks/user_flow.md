# ðŸ§­ ConvictionFi User Flow (v1)

## User Flow

### â‘  Mint Phase â€“ Choose and Commit

- The user selects an NFT that represents a specific investment strategy or ideological theme.
- By minting the NFT, the user crystallizes their conviction into a DeFAI Agent.
- **No further action or decision-making is required from the user.**

### â‘¡ Autonomous Phase â€“ The Agent Takes Over

- The minting amount is transferred to the NFTâ€™s associated **Agent Wallet**.
- The **DeFAI Agent** begins autonomous execution of its investment logic using the funds.
- The user can now fully disengage from trading and focus on their life and work.

### â‘¢ Notification Phase â€“ Transparent Updates

- A dedicated **notification Twitter account** sends periodic @replies to NFT holders with updates:

  - Current wallet balance
  - P\&L since minting
  - Most recent transaction details

- A **dashboard interface** also provides real-time performance data and status visibility.

### â‘£ Exit or Trade Phase â€“ Liquidity and Realization

- NFTs can be **resold on secondary markets**, allowing for speculation on ideological or strategic conviction.
- The user may **withdraw funds from the NFTâ€™s Agent Wallet**:

  - A **time-lock** may be enforced to delay withdrawal.
  - Alternatively, **withdrawals may be disallowed entirely**, and users can realize gains by selling the NFT based on its **floor price**.
