Submitted ConvictionFi to Sui Overflow 2025 — redefining the UX of DeFAI.

[🧠 ConvictionFi]
Just choose your conviction — and AI does the investing for you.
The UX? Simply mint an NFT.

[❗ PROBLEM]
 In 2025, DeFAI is one of the hottest trends in crypto.
 But most projects are still just buzzwords — no PMF, no real UX.

[💡 SOLUTION]
 ConvictionFi introduces two core conceptsthat define its ideal UX:
🌊 Vibe Trading on Conviction
🤖 DeFAI Agent as NFT
Each NFT represents a conviction — like SUI_MAXI, BTC_HODLER, or TRUMP_SUPPORTER.
Once minted, it becomes an autonomous AI agent that trades on your behalf.

[🧭 USER FLOW]
You only make one decision: minting.
1. Mint: Choose your NFT and mint it. That’s the only decision you make.
2. NFT = AI Agent: Each NFT runs its own wallet and trades autonomously using the mint price as its budget. Strategy logic and AI prompts are stored as metadata on Walrus.
3. Trade & Report: The agent trades, stakes, or lends. All actions are transparently posted via Twitter replies, turning each NFT into a viral marketing engine.
4. Evolve: Strategies evolve based on data and user feedback.
5. Exit: AI exits based on time or profit triggers, sending earnings to your wallet. Alternatively, just sell the NFT.
