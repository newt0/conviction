Please conduct a comprehensive DeepResearch investigation into the **Sui Agent Kit (SAK)**, focusing on its technical specifications, design philosophy, and practical use cases. Use the latest official documentation, GitHub repositories, and Sui Foundation announcements. Organize your findings in **Markdown format**, suitable for inclusion in developer technical documentation.

## üîç Topics to Cover:

1. **Overview and Design Philosophy**

   - The purpose of the Sui Agent Kit and its underlying rationale
   - Comparison with other on-chain/off-chain bot frameworks (e.g., Gelato, Autonolas)

2. **Core Components**

   - Agent definition files (e.g., `agent.json`)
   - Architecture of the scheduler, trigger, and execution modules
   - Deployment models and runtime environments

3. **Key Features**

   - Scheduled (cron-like) and conditional execution
   - Abstraction for Move contract calls
   - Differences between stateless and stateful agents

4. **Development and Operation**

   - Standard development workflow (local dev ‚Üí testnet ‚Üí mainnet)
   - Gas handling design, presence/absence of relayers
   - Compatibility with zkLogin and other authentication mechanisms

5. **Ecosystem Adoption and Use Cases**
   - Real-world projects utilizing SAK
   - Integration examples with other Sui-native protocols (e.g., DeepBook, Walrus)

Make sure to deliver actionable insights with clear technical depth, enabling developers to evaluate and implement Sui Agent Kit in real-world applications.
