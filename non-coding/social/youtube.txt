Mint your Conviction. DeFAI Agent as NFT.

ConvictionFi offers an ideal DeFAI UX through NFTs.
With a single NFT mint, users can delegate conviction-based investing to an autonomous AI agent.

〈PROJECT OVERVIEW〉
- Entry: Sui Overflow 2025 Hackathon
- Track: AI
- Product Type: DeFAI NFT Protocol
- Tagline: “Vibe Trading on Conviction. DeFAI Agent as NFT.”

〈❗PROBLEM: DeFAI Is Just a Buzzword〉
In 2025, DeFAI (DeFi × AI) is one of crypto’s hottest trends — but most products lack depth.
Use cases remain vague, UX is fragmented, and the core value of “using DeFAI” is unclear.

〈💡SOLUTION: Vibe Trading on Conviction. DeFAI Agent as NFT〉
ConvictionFi introduces two key concepts to deliver a real DeFAI experience:
- 🌊 Vibe Trading on Conviction
- 🤖 DeFAI Agent as NFT

Users mint an NFT tied to their conviction — e.g., $SUI_MAXI, $BTC_HODLER, or $TRUMP_SUPPORTER.
Each NFT becomes an AI agent with its own smart contract wallet and trading strategy.
Mint it, and let the agent handle the rest.

〈🧭USER-FLOW: Just Mint NFT〉
ConvictionFi follows a five-step flow, but users make only one decision: minting.
1. Mint — Pick and mint your NFT.
2. NFT = AI Agent — It gets its own wallet and trades using the mint amount.
3. Trade & Report — Autonomous activity is posted via Twitter replies, making each NFT a self-marketing engine.
4. Evolve — Strategies learn and improve over time.
5. Exit — AI auto-exits via time or profit triggers. Or, sell the NFT on a marketplace.

〈FEATURES: 🛡️ New Security Model: Safety Layer as NFT〉
DeFi traditionally requires users to interact directly with contracts — exposing them to unnecessary risk.
ConvictionFi offers a better model:
- No separate deposits or approvals. Minting = Funding
- Minting Price = Trading Budget
- Each NFT creates a fully isolated smart contract wallet
- Only the agent signs transactions
- Your main wallet stays untouched

Your conviction is tokenized, your risk is compartmentalized, and your NFT acts autonomously.

〈FEATURES: 🧠 Walrus Integration: AI Works on Walrus〉
All ConvictionNFTs store AI prompts, trading logic, and agent history as verifiable metadata on Walrus, a decentralized append-only storage system.
Stored data includes:
- Strategy parameters and reasoning
- Risk thresholds and execution policies
- Version history with immutable timestamps
- JSON-formatted metadata accessible via CID/URI

This ensures full auditability, upgrade traceability, and governance potential — without storing bloated data directly on-chain.

〈💸REVENUE: Sustainable Revenue, Seamless UX〉
ConvictionFi aligns sustainable monetization with a seamless UX:
- Mint Fee: $5–7 flat — incentivizes larger commitments.
- Royalty: 5% on secondary trades — drives exit-based liquidity.
- Success Fee: 7% one-time only when wallet hits 10× mint value — earns access to The 10x Club SBT, linked to $CONVICTION airdrops.

No hidden fees. Fiat and cross-chain minting supported with minimal friction.
We optimize for TVL and user growth — not extractive monetization.
