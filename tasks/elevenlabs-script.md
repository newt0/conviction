# 🎙️ ConvictionFi — TTS ナレーション台本（ElevenLabs 対応）

---

**Imagine minting an NFT once —**
and never worrying about crypto trading again.

We present: **ConvictionFi.**
_Mint Your Conviction. Def-Fay-Eye Agent as NFT._

---

Everyone talks about **Def-Fay-Eye** —
Decentralized Finance, powered by AI.
Some even call it “Vibe Trading.”

But in reality?
It’s just a buzzword.
No one knows how to actually use it.

**We don’t just say Def-Fay-Eye or Vibe Trading.**
We deliver it —
through a simple, self-contained interface:

**Def-Fay-Eye Agent as NFT.**
Mint once. Let the agent do the rest.

---

This is Conviction-Driven Automation. On-chain. On NFT.

You don’t manage positions.
You don’t time markets.
You just mint.

Each NFT becomes your autonomous agent.
It holds your funds.
It executes trades.
It reports — transparently, automatically, relentlessly.

All on its own.

---

## Step 1: Choose and Mint Conviction

Select a thesis — like staking SUI, or HODLing BTC.
Mint an NFT.
That’s it.

No dashboards.
No approvals.
No setup.

**From this moment, your conviction is on-chain.**
From here, it acts — not you.

---

## Step 2: Initialize and Deploy

The NFT creates its own smart wallet.
Your mint price?
It’s transferred into that wallet — and becomes trading capital.

The agent loads its logic and prompt from Walrus.
It deploys via Sui Agent Kit.
Now it’s ready to act.

---

## Step 3: Trade and Report

The agent executes trades, staking, or lending.
It reacts to live market data — with no human input.

And it keeps you updated —
**publicly, through Twitter replies.**

Wallet balance.
Trade logs.
Performance since mint.

Your friends can see it.
They can comment.
They can follow along.

Each reply becomes a growth node —
turning belief into visibility.

And if you prefer privacy?
There’s a dashboard for that, too.

**Transparency fuels trust.
Social feedback fuels growth.**

---

## Step 4: Learn and Evolve

Agents aren’t frozen in time.
Their logic is stored on Walrus — and it’s upgradable.

They learn.
They adapt.
They evolve with the market.

But one thing never changes:
**The conviction minted in the NFT.**
It stays immutable.

_The mind may evolve.
But the soul stays the same._

---

## Step 5: Exit or Transfer

Most agents exit automatically —
when goals are met, or conditions are triggered.

But users still have a choice.
You can transfer your NFT.
Or, if allowed, trigger a refund.

**Exit is guided by belief —
but agency is never taken away.**

---

Most DeFi apps ask you to sign from your main wallet.
That’s not just clunky — it’s dangerous.

> Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.

We don’t.

Every NFT uses an isolated wallet.
You never sign again.
And even if the strategy fails —
**your personal funds stay safe.**

NFTs aren’t just assets.
They’re **firewalls between you and protocol risk.**

---

**You mint your conviction.
Your agent lives it.
Autonomously. Transparently. On-chain.**

---

One mint.
One conviction.
One unstoppable agent.

Built for believers — not just traders.
Where AI acts for you — not over you.
Where NFTs become living vaults of conviction.

**ConvictionFi.**
Where belief becomes automation.
Where conviction becomes capital.

Thank you.
