# ✅ ConvictionFi Pitch Script

## Title

Imagine minting an NFT once — and never worrying about crypto trading again.

We present **ConvictionFi**.
Our slogan: _"Mint Your Conviction. DeFAI Agent as NFT."_

## 🔥 MARKET REALITY: DeFi × AI is Inevitable, Yet Unfair

Crypto investing has outgrown human attention.
Every day — over 140,000 new tokens emerge.
Too fast. Too fragmented. Too volatile.

AI could have helped.
Instead, it's become a secret weapon for the elite —
those who can fine-tune prompts, manage bots, and deploy capital faster than you can think.

The result?

**They get richer.
Everyone else gets wrecked.**

AI didn’t democratize finance.
It centralized it further.

That’s why we built ConvictionFi:
To let conviction — not expertise — be your edge.

---

## 💡 SOLUTION: ConvictionFi — Your Conviction, Your Agent

We call this model: **Conviction-Driven Automation**.

You don’t need to learn yield strategies or manage positions.

You just mint.
Each NFT is a self-governing agent — tailored to a belief, a narrative, a thesis.

It holds funds.
It trades.
It reports back to you — all autonomously.

Just one mint.
And your conviction takes over.

---

## HOW IT WORKS: Mint. Delegate. Relax.

Each ConvictionFi NFT represents a strategic belief:
"Stake \$SUI until blue-chip rotation,"
or "HODL \$BTC and lend for yield."

You choose a thesis, mint the NFT — and it becomes your proxy.

- Each NFT has its own wallet
- Funds are deposited on mint
- Agents manage it using **Sui Agent Kit** — interacting with dApps, DEXs, and oracles

You stay hands-off.
Your agent stays on-chain.

---

## FEATURES: Safe. Serverless. Effortless.

- **Isolated Wallets**: No cross-NFT risk
- **Prepaid Mint**: Your budget = trade budget
- **No SUI? No Wallet?** Use Twitter with **zkLogin**
- **Gasless Options** via sponsored transactions
- **Cross-Chain Ready** via **Wormhole**

No approvals.
No dashboards.
Just conviction, encoded.

## 🧠 TECH STACK: Built on Sui. Powered by Agents.

This is not "AI on blockchain."
This is AI **embedded in blockchain logic**.

- **Sui Agent Kit (SAK)**: Schedules + executes strategy triggers via programmable agents
- **Walrus**: Stores agent config & metadata in decentralized storage
- **zkLogin + Privy**: Enables social login & onboarding
- **Wormhole**: Opens cross-chain expansion
- **Stripe (planned)**: Enables fiat-based NFT minting

It’s **Sui-native** — designed around Move, parallelism, and object-centric design.

---

## 🎯 Vision

DeFi should be for believers, not just bots.

Our vision?

- Let anyone invest with belief, not technical skill
- Let NFTs become **autonomous vaults of conviction**
- Let AI democratize action — not just prediction

**From one mint...
to ten thousand agents...
to a world where conviction trades itself.**

## Ending

ConvictionFi:
Where belief becomes automation.
Where conviction becomes capital.

Thank you.
