You are an expert in Sui Move (2024 edition).  
Please fix the following `conviction_fi.move` file based on the actual compiler errors.

---

### ðŸ›  Objective:

Make the entire module compile cleanly under Move 2024 edition using `sui move build`.

---

### ðŸ“„ Source file:

Apply all necessary changes to `sources/conviction_fi.move`.

---

### ðŸ”´ Compilation Errors and Warnings:

```
[note] Dependencies on Bridge, MoveStdlib, Sui, and SuiSystem are automatically added, but this feature is disabled for your package because you have explicitly included dependencies on Sui. Consider removing these dependencies from Move.toml.
