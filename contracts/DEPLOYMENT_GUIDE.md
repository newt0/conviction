## Production Deployment Configuration

### Move.toml Configuration
```toml
[package]
name = "ConvictionFi"
version = "1.0.0"
edition = "2024.beta"

[dependencies]
Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "framework/mainnet" }

[addresses]
conviction_fi = "0x0"

[dev-dependencies]

[dev-addresses]
conviction_fi = "0x0"
```

## CLI Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Install Sui CLI (latest version)
2. Configure wallet for target network
3. Ensure sufficient SUI for gas fees

### Step 1: Build and Test
```bash
# Build the contract
sui move build

# Run comprehensive test suite
sui move test

# Run specific test functions
sui move test test_complete_workflow
sui move test test_security_edge_cases
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Testnet
```bash
# Switch to testnet
sui client switch --env testnet

# Check active address
sui client active-address

# Deploy with adequate gas budget
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Mainnet
```bash
# Switch to mainnet
sui client switch --env mainnet

# Verify network and address
sui client envs
sui client active-address

# Deploy to mainnet with higher gas budget
sui client publish --gas-budget 200000000
```

### Gas Budget Recommendations
- **Testnet**: 100,000,000 MIST (0.1 SUI)
- **Mainnet**: 200,000,000 MIST (0.2 SUI)
- **Large deployments**: 500,000,000 MIST (0.5 SUI)

### Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Get package ID from deployment output
export PACKAGE_ID=<package_id_from_deployment>

# Verify package information
sui client object $PACKAGE_ID

# Test basic functionality
sui client call --package $PACKAGE_ID --module core --function get_system_stats
```

### Network Configuration
- **Testnet RPC**: https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
- **Mainnet RPC**: https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443
- **Faucet (Testnet)**: https://faucet.testnet.sui.io/

### Security Considerations
1. **Admin Keys**: Secure storage of AdminCap objects
2. **Upgrade Path**: Consider upgrade mechanisms for future versions
3. **Emergency Procedures**: Document emergency admin procedures
4. **Monitoring**: Set up event monitoring for production deployment

### Initial Configuration
After deployment, the deployer will automatically receive:
- **AdminCap**: Level 3 with full permissions
- **Global Objects**: SharedConfig and StrategyRegistry
- **Initial Settings**: Conservative defaults suitable for mainnet

### Recommended First Actions
1. Add initial investment strategies via `add_strategy`
2. Configure appropriate fee rates via `update_global_config`
3. Set up monitoring for delegation and agent activities
4. Test with small amounts before full launch

## Contract Specifications
- **Module**: `conviction_fi::core`
- **Language**: Move 2024 Edition
- **Framework**: Sui Framework (mainnet branch)
- **Gas Optimized**: Yes, efficient object handling
- **Security Level**: Production-ready with comprehensive validation
