# convictionfi-contracts

## ✅ Project Summary

- **Goal**: Win the **Sui Overflow Hackathon 2025**
- **Deliverable**: Smart contract written in **Sui Move**
- **Prerequisites**:

  - The project’s overall requirements and specifications are already completed
  - Considerations for dApp integration and Web2 components are sufficiently defined
  - MVP-level Move contract development can begin immediately

- **Resources**: All necessary AI tools are subscribed and ready for use

## 🧠 AI Tools Used

ChatGPT and Claude are the two core AI engines for this project.

- **ChatGPT**:

  - Used via browser
  - Maintains deep contextual memory across chats about the ConvictionFi project
  - Weaker in Move knowledge (even after training via search), less accurate than Claude

- **Claude**:

  - Used via browser
  - No persistent memory, but stronger proficiency in Move than ChatGPT
  - Excellent at code generation

- **Claude Code**:

  - Used via CLI
  - Currently exploring optimal directory/file structures to maximize performance

- **VSCode Copilot**:

  - Used locally
  - For GitHub repo management and minor code adjustments

- **Cursor**:

  - Used locally
  - For small code edits
  - Not expected to be used for full-scale Move development

## 🔁 AI-Powered Development Workflow

_Note: The actual flow is not strictly linear — we often circle back to ChatGPT for clarifications or restructuring._

### Phase 1: Defining Requirements with ChatGPT

1. Use ChatGPT to distinguish between smart contract functionality and external (dApp/Web2) logic
2. Organize all required Move-side features in text form
3. Review and refine the specs as needed
4. Translate the finalized specs into English

### Phase 2: Prompt Design with Claude

1. Feed the spec into Claude to generate Move-compatible prompts
2. Apply a "harsh critique prompt" to maximize output quality:

> Let’s say this output scores 60/100.
> What is missing for it to be a 100?
> List the gaps, and then rewrite the answer to reach 100/100.

3. \[WIP] The refined prompt improves accuracy but is too long for single-shot execution. So, split it into modular stages for sequential processing.

### Phase 3: Contract Generation with Claude Code

1. Use ChatGPT to research and learn how Claude Code works
2. \[WIP] Use ChatGPT to define a directory structure and file set that maximizes Claude Code's performance (e.g., prompt chunking)

```md
convictionfi-move/
├── sources/
│ └── conviction_fi.move # Output from Claude goes here
├── .claude/
│ └── commands/
│ ├── 01_core_infra.md
│ ├── 02_security.md
│ ├── 03_ai_agent.md
│ ├── 04_testing.md
│ ├── 05_events.md
│ ├── 06_advanced_features.md
│ ├── 07_utilities_init.md
│ ├── 08_deployment.md
│ └── README.md # Overview of modular prompt design
└── CLAUDE.md # Project-level requirements and assumptions
```

3. Based on the long-form prompt generated by Claude, use ChatGPT to split and implement the files above

- _Note: All prompts and files will eventually be translated into English for final execution, since English yields higher quality outputs. Initial drafts are reviewed in Japanese._

4. \[NOT STARTED] Begin step-by-step execution using Claude Code
